# LatticeSummerSchool2021-ScatteringExercises

Exercises for the "Problem Solving in Lattice QCD" summer school, 
https://sites.google.com/uw.edu/lqcdschool2021


## Outline

* Few notebooks with many examples/ exercises? (Keegan votes for this)
* Many notebooks focusing on subtopics?

* Only do $S$ wave, maybe some bonus exercises in higher waves

Here is a rough outline for the exercises:
### Scattering
* Brief review on complex analysis: branch cuts, poles, contour integrals
* Two-particle kinematics: energies/ momenta, two-body phase space
* Two-body scattering amplitudes: Breit-Wigner, Effective range, plots on real axis, unitarity, phases
* Analytic continuation: bound/virtual/resonant states, branch cuts, pole finding, residues

### Finite-Volume Scattering
* Free spectrum: plot free spectrum, counting of contributing shells, moving frames shift spectra
* Luscher function: Derive KSS Zeta function, plot for given parameters, recover free spectrum from poles of Zeta
* Interacting spectrum: Given amplitude (BW or ERE), plot FV spectrum
* Toy data analysis: Given some data, use QC to determine scattering parameters
* MAYBE: some data analysis tools - Jackknife sampling, maybe wrap with Toy data analysis

### Photoproduction
* Single hadron Lorentz decomposition of form-factors
* 1+J->2: Lorentz decomposition, analytic representation, Watson's theorem
* FV: LL factors, trace relation
